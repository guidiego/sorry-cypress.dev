The ReactJS web dashboard uses the [API service](/api) to display the test results and currently running tests. You can browse test details and failure messages.

When a [Storage driver](/director/storage) is configured, you can also see screenshots and video recordings (if enabled).

You can explore an example dashboard at https://sorry-cypress-demo.herokuapp.com/.

## Configuration

### GRAPHQL_SCHEMA_URL

Set the environment variable `GRAPHQL_SCHEMA_URL` with the URL of [API service](/api).
GraphQL client will use it to pull schema definitions and issue queries.

```sh
GRAPHQL_SCHEMA_URL='https://sorry-cypress-demo-api.herokuapp.com'
```

### CI_URL

Set optional environment variable `CI_URL` to add a link to your CI tool.

```sh
CI_URL=Link name,https://your.ci.service/project/{project_id}/build/{build_id}
```

Where:

- `Link name` is the link name, for example: `Travis CI`, `Drone CI`, `Circle CI`.
- `{project_id}` is a templating tag for cypress project name - will be injected dynamically.
- `{build_id}` is a templating tag for ID passed to cypress via `--ci-build-id` parameter - will be injected dynamically.
